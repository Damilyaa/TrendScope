Challenges remain in overcoming resistance from established power structures and scaling these movements to a national or global level. However, the focus on healing societal divisions and prioritizing long-term well-being resonates with many, suggesting a continued, albeit slow, growth in influence. The success will depend upon their ability to engage younger people."
