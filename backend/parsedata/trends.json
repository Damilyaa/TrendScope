While full implementation remains unlikely in most countries, pilot programs and expansion of existing social safety nets are probable. Expect debates on funding mechanisms, service delivery models, and the optimal scope of UBS. The success of pilot programs will significantly influence future political support and wider adoption. Ultimately, UBS's future hinges on its perceived impact on economic growth, social equity, and individual well-being."
