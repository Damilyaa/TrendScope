Rather than relying on a centralized perimeter, CSMA establishes a security perimeter around each individual identity or access point. This enables organizations to adapt their security posture dynamically based on the specific risks and needs of different parts of their environment. As organizations embrace cloud computing, IoT devices, and remote work, the traditional perimeter is becoming increasingly porous, making CSMA an essential component of modern cybersecurity strategies. By 2025, CSMA is becoming the standard approach to securing complex and distributed IT environments. The focus is on identity-centric security and fine-grained access control.",
