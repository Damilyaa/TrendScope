      "futureOutlook": "DAOs will continue to evolve and gain wider adoption as blockchain technology matures. They will be used in various sectors, including finance, art, and governance. Regulatory frameworks will be developed to provide clarity and legal recognition for DAOs. The development of user-friendly tools and interfaces will make DAOs more accessible to non-technical users. DAOs could restructure global organizations, but more likely will fill niche areas like managing funding and voting for small groups. The future success of DAOs will depend on the ability to address security concerns and regulatory challenges."

Government regulations and consumer pressure will drive greater transparency and accountability. The rise of circular economy models, such as clothing rental and resale platforms, will become more prevalent. In the long term, sustainable fashion will become the default, with fast fashion brands forced to adapt or become obsolete. This shift will contribute to a more responsible and ethical fashion industry."
